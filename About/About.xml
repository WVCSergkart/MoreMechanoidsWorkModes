	<description>Adds 10 new work mods for mechanoids:

Find and destroy - Mechanoids, regardless of their type, will look for enemies and try to destroy them.

Work and recharge - Work autonomously according to mechanoid type. If the mechanoid cannot work or it has done all the work it shuts down.

Escort and recharge - The mechanoid, regardless of its type, will accompany the overseer and, if necessary, go to charge.

Work, recharge and escort - The mechanoid will accompany the overseer if it does not have a job, and will also be charged if necessary.

Wait enemy - The mechanoid will shutdown and wait for the enemy, and when it appears, it will wake up and head towards the target.

Work and wait - Mechanoids, depending on the type, will work, and when an enemy appears, they will drop everything and go to destroy him. If they don't have a job, they'll just shutdown.

Ambush - The mechanoid shutdown and waits for the enemy to approach it, then attacks.

Defend yourself - Mechanoid, regardless of type, will attack enemies that get too close.

Escort if enemy - Mechanoids, regardless of type, will accompany the overseer, but only if there is an enemy on the map. When there is no enemy, mechanoids shutdown.

Work if safe - Mechanoids will work, but only as long as there are no enemies on the map. In case of danger, they will try to get to the safe spot.</description>
